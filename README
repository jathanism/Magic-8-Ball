Magic 8-Ball 1.0
================
Script created by Jathan McCollum
For use with the Adium instant messaging client on Mac OS X
Inspired by the original Magic 8-Ball toy by Alabe Crafts Company

Installation:
=============
To install Magic 8-Ball, simply double-click on the "magic8ball.AdiumScripts" document included with this ReadMe file. Adium should display a message telling that the script has been installed.

If you would like to install the script without launching Adium, or Adium has problems installing Magic 8-Ball, copy "magic8ball.AdiumScripts" to ~Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Scripts/

Upon installation, you may erase the .zip file, this readme, and magic8ball.AdiumScripts (unless it is the copy located in ~Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Scripts/). 

Usage:
======
To use Magic 8-Ball, simply type "/magic8ball" "/8ball" or "%_8ball" in your instant message window. Upon sending your message, the script will replace "/magic8ball" with one of 20 different answers. You may also use Magic 8-Ball in your profile or away messages. This will automatically change your profile and/or away message to a different answer every so often.
